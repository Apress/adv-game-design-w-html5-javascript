/*
Create the grid of pegs using the `grid` function. `grid` returns a
`group` sprite object that contains a sprite for every cell in the
grid. You can define the rows and columns in the grid, whether or
not the sprites should be centered inside each cell, or what their offset from the
top left corner of each cell should be. Supply a function that
returns the sprite that you want to make for each cell. You can
supply an optional final function that runs any extra code after
each sprite has been created. Here's the format for creating a grid:

    gridGroup = grid(

      //Set the grid's properties
      columns, rows, cellWidth, cellHeight, 
      areSpirtesCentered?, xOffset, yOffset,

      //A function that returns a sprite
      () => g.circle(16, "blue"),

      //An optional final function that runs some extra code
      () => console.log("extra!")
    );
*/

bricks = grid(
  //Set the grid's properties
  5, 4, 48, 48, 
  true, 0, 0,
  //A function that describes how to make each peg in the grid.
  //A random diameter and color is selected for each one
  () => {
    let brick = rectangle(randomInt(8, 32), randomInt(8, 32));
    let colors = [
      "#FFABAB", "#FFDAAB", "#DDFFAB", 
      "#ABE4FF", "#D9ABFF"
    ];
    brick.fillStyle = colors[randomInt(0, 4)];
    return brick;
  },
  //Run any extra code after each peg is made, if you want to
  () => console.log("extra!")
);

//Position the grid of pegs
bricks.setPosition(8, 48);

//Start the game loop
gameLoop();

function gameLoop() {
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);

  //Apply gravity to the ball's vertical velocity
  ball.vy += ball.gravity;
  
  //Apply friction. ball.frictionX will be 0.96 if the ball is
  //on the ground, and 1 if it's in the air
  ball.vx *= ball.frictionX;

  //Move the ball by applying the new calculated velocity
  //to the ball's x and y position
  ball.x += ball.vx;
  ball.y += ball.vy;

  //make the ball bounce by setting setting the last argument 
  //in the `contain` method to `true`
  var stageCollision = contain(ball, stage.localBounds, true);

  //If the ball hit the bottom of the stage, add some so
  //that the ball gradually rolls to a stop
  if(stageCollision === "bottom") {
    ball.frictionX = 0.96;
  } else {
    ball.frictionX = 1;
  }


  //Check for a collision between the ball and the bricks
  bricks.children.forEach(brick => {
    
    //Make the ball bounce if it hits any of the pegs. Use the 
    //`circleCollision` function to check for collisions between
    //a moving circle and a stationary circle. Set the third argument to
    //`true` to make the circle from bounce, and set the fourth
    //argument to `true` if you want to use the circle's global x/y
    //coordinates. (The global coordinates will be used by default)
    //`circleCollision` arguments:
    //movingCircle, stationaryCircle, bounce?, globalCoordinates?
    
    circleRectangleCollision(ball, brick, true, true);
  });

  //arguments: circle, arrayOfCircles, reactToCollision?,
  //bounceApart?, global?
